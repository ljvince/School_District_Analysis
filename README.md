## Summary:
#### the overall passing rate for Thomas High School changed risen from 65% to 91%, however, we will point out a new  result when we looking at the Thomas High School, avoid have a worry vision of this school. in the meanwhile, the school ranking also get so many different, Thomas High School get into top 5, located no.2 of the school ranking.

#### in this project, because the total count of student is a large amount of number which is 38709, and Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading score only 461, therefore some time the changes will be seen in a very small way, and the larger data views will have no a lot of change. this shows that the delete 9th score is will not affect the whole percentage but still get the School in the right ranking place and exactly passing rate. 

#### in the really world we indeed see a lot of worry data value and we want to fix it, in order to see if we could make things right. however, i have learned a lot of thinking and methods in this module. I wanna appreciate every one who helps me recently. thank you !
